App Service Demo - Bring your own storage

This dotnetcore web application is a sample application that shows how you can use the "Bring your own storage" feature in Azure App Services to integrate your App Service with an Azure storage (blobs or files)

The home page refers to some images and css files that are in an azure blob storage and Azure app services can be configured to mount the blob storage to have those contents readily available to the web application.
